================

A WorldGuard-ish plugin for Minebuilder
---------------------------------------
_______________________________________

Feel free to use the source code to make a custom BlockGuard plugin for your server, you can also use the source code to make a new (better) WorldGuard. (it would be nice if you could notify me in that case)

Do you have any questions? Feel free to ask something here: http://www.space-walrus.com/topic/1566/blockguard-worldguard

Do you see something that can be improved? Feel free to Pull Requests

_______________________________________

Note:
This plugin is supposed to work without depending on other plugins.
However, the plugin DOES support MBWorldEdit's Wand Blocks for the convenience of the user.
This means BlockGuard works without the MBWorldEdit installed and also works with the MBWorldEdit plugin installed.
